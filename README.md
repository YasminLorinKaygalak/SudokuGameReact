Here is the website for the game: https://yasminlorinkaygalakcsc2053project1.netlify.app/
* I created a sudoku games that advises the user playing the "X" to win.
* When the user clicks certain block that would not strategically let them win, it witholds the user from playing, and advises that it is not a smart choice.
* If the user clicks on a block that is strategically smart, it lets the user do so and states that it is a good choice.
* Game can be restarted and be played over as many times wanted.
